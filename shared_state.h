// Cross-core sequencer state. Read/written by:
//   Core 0 — DFAMSequencer::ProcessSample at 48 kHz
//   Core 1 — Grid loop or USB MIDI device loop
//
// All fields are single-byte or naturally aligned 32-bit, so reads and
// writes are atomic on the Cortex-M0+. The `volatile` qualifier on the
// global instance forces the compiler to re-read on every access so that
// changes from one core become visible on the other without explicit
// synchronisation.
//
// Direction of writes:
//   pitch, velocity, seqLength, playing — written by either core
//   editStep                            — written by either core
//   currentStep                         — written by core 0 only
//   tickEpoch                           — incremented by core 0 on every
//                                         step advance; core 1 polls it
//                                         to know when to redraw / send
//                                         a tick notification
